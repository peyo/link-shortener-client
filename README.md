# link shortener

This is an exercise to build a simple service using Apollo and GraphQL.

# challenge

Create a link shortener application. The goal was to build a full-stack React web app to write data through a GraphQL back-end. Once the data was written through a form, it would be displayed in a list below the form. I also limited myself to mobile first responsive layout and styling using Material UI.

# non-requirements

The challenge did not expect a fully working URL shortener. For example, a working redirect when clicking on a shortened URL was not required.
